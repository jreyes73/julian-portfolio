            <h3>Fruition Ed.</h3>
            <p>Fruition Ed. is my most recent project, and it's the project I am most proud of. It is the results of years of diliberating, planning, and creating ideas that came from my professional experience in education and my experience of being a father.</p>
            <p>Fruition Ed. is an customized educational program that engages young learners by requiring users to submit photos of their own to complete the stories. Learners are able to easily relate with the stories because it is their own images that they see in the stories.</p>
            <h4>Sprout Series</h4>
            <p>Furthermore, The beginning level, Sprout Series, was created by using nursery rhymes to work as a first exposure to English for the youngest of learners. For example, one nursery rhyme is Old MacDonald had a farm. So users are required to submit photos of animals that are mentioned in the song. The photos could be of real-life farm animals, toy animals, costumes of animals, or even drawings that they created. While the stories have text, the students are not expected to "read" the stories, instead the text is more for parents/teachers to read to the learner.</p>
            <h4>Spring Series</h4>
            <p>Spring Series is the second level in the program. The stories in the Spring Series are focused on topics related to our daily lives. These topics include colors, shapes, safety, and weather, and much more.</p>
            <p>Young Learners with not only learn about the world around them; out methodology allows learners to experience the world first-hand, and often for the first time</p>
            <h4>Blossom Series</h4>
            <p>The third level in the series is the Blossom Series. At this stage, our learners have now moved onto short stories that encourage them to use their imagination and creativity. Users are asked to submit images of to match the fictional stories so often times users can be creative with coming up with the scenes.</p>
            <h4>Forest Series</h4>
            <p>The Forest Series, our final level, expands on the Blossom series and introduces more complex and engaging storylines.</p>
            <hr />
            <h4>Program Components</h4>
            <p>Each Level has 10 storybooks, and each storybook takes 1 month to complete for a total of 1 year for each level and 4 years to complete all levels from beginning to end.</p>
            <p>Each storybook has an accompanying workbook. In one month there are 8 lessons to complete. Since the workbooks are not customized, learners are able to see the key terms and words in a variety of ways. In addition to the workbook, students have access to the digital, interactive content so they can work alongside. </p>
