            <h3>The Origins Game</h3>
            <p>The Origins Game was my first major project that I ever pursue and seeing it come to life had been a dream of mine for the better part of 10 years.</p>
            <p>Background</p>
            <p>My idea for the game actually came from a Sunday evening meal at an Nepalese-Indian restaurant in Seoul. My 3 friends and I ate our early dinner and since we werent' in a rush and there weren't any other customers in the resturant we sat there for what it seems or hours just chatting about the most random things. My friends and I all came from different countries; Michael from South Africa, Danielle from Canada, Daniella from Italy, and the US (that's me), and our language to communciate in was English.<br/>Somehow, and almost suddenly, Daniella starts telling us the meaning of a word in Italian. This turned telling completely a made up story about the origins of the word. That gave use such a good laugh that we each went around table each saying a word in our second languages, respectively. We had never really realized until then that we all spoke a language in addition to English; Michael spoke Afrikaans, Danielle spoke a bit of Portugese, Daniella's first language was Italian, and I grew up speaking Spanish.</p>
            <p>After that evening, we went on our way and we never really thought much of it. But every once in awhile, when Michael and I were in a group of people we would revert back to this story telling amusement. We found that it worked great with people that spoke different languages, but with the power of the internet, it wasn't difficult to search for a random word in a language knew none of.</p>
            <p>Something about the game and the aspect of improv that I found so amusing and the uncomfortness of someone stumbling through a story as they made up line by line that really amused me.</p>
            <p>Thats why i eventually decided that I wanted to turn it into a board game or card game. First I started off with making it into a phyiscal card game. I made up cards with words in various languages, directions of how to play, and even had to create a point system since there was never a points awarded in the early iterations of the game.</p>
            <p>After making the card game version, I decided to make an app version. Unfortunately, I had no clue how to make an app and to be honest, didn't even realized that it required coding skills. So I decided that I would make a prototype version on PowerPoint and I would use all the different animations to simulate how it would be as an app. It was uh... good enough for what I wanted.</p>
            <p>After a couple of failed pitches to companies, I shelved the project for a couple of years. It wasn't until I learned to code that I started to consider to actually create a web application for it. And here it is!</p>
